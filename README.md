# Machine_Learning_A-Z

This repository is to archive the code templates of different machine learning models I learnt in the Udemy course [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/). The core of the code templates is from that course, however, I organized different parts in my favor and even improved some of the original templates. I am still learning and exploring different machine learning models and will archive those in this repository too.
